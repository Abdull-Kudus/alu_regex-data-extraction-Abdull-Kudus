# Regex Data Extraction Project

## Project Overview

This project extracts and categorizes specific data types from strings using **regular expressions**. It identifies 7 common patterns such as:

- HTML tags
- Currency amounts
- Credit card numbers
- Phone numbers
- URLs
- Email addresses
- Time (12-hour & 24-hour formats)

The script applies regex patterns to each category and outputs matches in the console for easy verification.

## Key Features

- **Regex-based Extraction:** Efficiently identifies multiple data types.  
- **Categorized Matching:** Each type of data is processed separately.  
- **Dynamic Handling:** Supports variations like different phone number formats, email domains, and credit card formats.  
- **Console Output:** Matched results displayed clearly for verification.

## Use Cases

- **Data Validation:** Check emails, URLs, phone numbers, and credit cards.  
- **Text Parsing:** Extract relevant data for processing or reporting.  
- **Web Scraping:** Identify and extract HTML tags and URLs from web pages.
